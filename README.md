 Features Implemented
 Core Requirements

Landing Page - Hero section with wavy background

Authentication - Login/Signup with localStorage session management

Dashboard - Ticket statistics with responsive cards

Ticket Management - Full CRUD with validation and status tracking

## Design Consistency
Max Width: 1440px centered layout

Wavy Hero: SVG background in landing page

Status Colors: Green (open), Amber (in progress), Gray (closed)

Responsive: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS

Decorative Elements: Circles and card shadows throughout

## Security & Validation
Route Protection: Automatic redirect for unauthorized access

Form Validation: Real-time client-side validation

Session Management: ticketapp_session in localStorage

Error Handling: Toast notifications and inline errors

## Key Implementation Details
Component Architecture
Modular Templates: Reusable components for navigation, forms, tickets

Partial Sections: Hero, features, and ticket components

Consistent Layout: Base template with block sections

##Authentication Flow
Session stored in localStorage with ticketapp_session key

Automatic redirect to login for protected routes (/dashboard, /tickets)

Mock user database in ticketapp_users

Ticket Management
Status Validation: Only accepts "open", "in_progress", "closed"

Real-time Filtering: Search by title/description, filter by status/priority

Inline Editing: Seamless create/edit experience

Delete Confirmation: Modal confirmation for ticket deletion

## Development
Adding New Pages
Create template in templates/pages/

Add route in index.php

Update navigation in templates/components/navigation.twig

Customizing Components
Modify component templates in templates/components/

Update styles with Tailwind classes

Add new partials in templates/partials/

JavaScript Architecture
app.js - Main application bootstrap

auth.js - Authentication and session management

tickets.js - Ticket CRUD operations and filtering

## Known Issues
Basic toast notifications using console.log (implement UI in toast.twig)

No server-side persistence (localStorage only)

Requires page refresh after signup for auto-login

## Support
Check browser console for JavaScript errors and ensure all Twig templates are properly rendered by PHP.

Note: This is the Twig implementation. See other frameworks for React and Vue.js versions with identical functionality.
